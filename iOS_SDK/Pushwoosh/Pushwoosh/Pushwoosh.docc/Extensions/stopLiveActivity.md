# ``Pushwoosh/stopLiveActivity()``

@Metadata {
    @DocumentationExtension(mergeBehavior: override)
}

Stops the current live activity.

## Discussion

**Deprecated since 6.8.0**: Use `Pushwoosh.LiveActivities.stopLiveActivity` instead.

Call this method when you finish working with a live activity. This notifies the server that the live activity has ended.
